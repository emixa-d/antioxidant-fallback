Libraries are by default put in the 'lib' output when that exists, 'out' otherwise.
Crate info files are by default put in the 'env' output when that exists, 'lib' or 'out' otherwise.
Binaries are by default put in the 'bin' when that output exists, 'out' otherwise.
Examples binaries are put in 'example', or 'bin', or 'out' instead.
Benchmark binaries are put in 'benchmarks', or 'bin', or 'out' instead.
Test binaries are put in 'tests', or 'bin', or 'out' instead, but keep in mind that currently tests are not compiled by default when cross-compiling (this could change in the future if desired, but for now we keep the behaviour of other build systems).
