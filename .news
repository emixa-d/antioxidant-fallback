	(title (en "Feature variants of packages now supported"))
	(body (en "There now is some support for declaring multiple variants
of the same crate with a different set of features.  Theoretically, it should
now be possible to link multiple versions of the same thing into the same
binary, reducing the number of version conflicts (untested).  See README.md
for details."))))
